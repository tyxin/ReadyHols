    "Amidst the easing of COVID lockdown restrictions all around the globe, there is a sudden surge in demand for travelling. With so many vacations people desire to go for, organising the planning of these vacations is especially important to ensure that all the relevant aspects are planned for for a smooth trip. Especially for family vacations, those who plan these vacations would want a place to keep track of all the details required for the trip. They would also want the rest of their family to be informed of the trip itinerary to stay on track, even with the latest updates. Some families may also want a platform for them to share their fond memories of the trip together.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, a family centred holiday planning drive allows for the above functionalities to be achieved all at once. Not only is it beneficial to the people who plan, but also for the family members to all enjoy the trip together smoothly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to efficiently and structurely store vacations details, summaries, planning, sharings, a database should be used. A RDBMS system allows all of the data to be stored in a consistent manner where data type domains are kept strict to ensure the usability of the data, as well as efficient queuring and prevent data loss for the best user experience. By using a relational database, it ensures that all data updating and modifications are complete so no data is lost, consistency such that all users are able to see the same vacation details and allows all vacations to be updated simultaneously without affecting each other. Finally, it also ensures that no data is lost due to any technical faults by any single user once the data transaction is done to allow all users to use the drive without being affected."
