    "Amidst the easing of COVID lockdown restrictions all around the globe, there is a sudden surge in demand for travelling. With so many vacations people desire to go for, organising the planning of these vacations is especially important to ensure that all the relevant aspects are planned for for a smooth trip. Especially for family vacations, those who plan these vacations would want a place to keep track of all the details required for the trip. They would also want the rest of their family to be informed of the trip itinerary to stay on track, even with the latest updates. Some families may also want a platform for them to share their fond memories of the trip together.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, a family centred holiday planning drive allows for the above functionalities to be achieved all at once. Not only is it beneficial to the people who plan, but also for the family members to all enjoy the trip together smoothly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to efficiently and structurely store vacations details, summaries, planning, sharings, a database should be used. A RDBMS system allows all of the data to be stored in a consistent manner where data type domains are kept strict to ensure the usability of the data, as well as efficient queuring and prevent data loss for the best user experience. By using a relational database, it ensures that all data updating and modifications are complete so no data is lost, consistency such that all users are able to see the same vacation details and allows all vacations to be updated simultaneously without affecting each other. Finally, it also ensures that no data is lost due to any technical faults by any single user once the data transaction is done to allow all users to use the drive without being affected."

    "After completing this project, I realise the important of planning well from the start, especially for the ER diagram and relational schema since the entire project was based off these two diagrams. Business rules are also equally important, which did not appear to be as I originally thought that it could be inferred from the ER diagram but there are certain things that cannot be described only with one type of diagram and need all of them combined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without a good design, the implementation part becomes hard as you will realise that some parts do not flow well and need to modify everything from the basic design which is very time consuming. I think completing my project has affected my view that database is the biggest and most time consuming part of designing anything. I originally thought that the design would take way longer than integrating the interaction with the user on the client side with the UI design but they both took very long time.\n",
    " I think I have also learnt how to implement additional features not taught within the module which has helped me set the stage to go on to create my own websites which I believe will not only be useful in my studies but also in everyday tasks with the new learnt thinking process. \n",
    " \n",
    "I think that I could have managed my time better. Although I have been consistently working on the project since the start of the year, I felt that I still did a lot more to the later stages. I think the different phases has helped us checkpoint our progress and ensure that we are on the right path to prevent a huge backlog of work, but I feel that the weightage of the first few parts should be less and more should be on the final product with all the integration and design complete as in the first few stages we were still exploring and trying out what was the best design. \n",
    "I think that the nature of this project is quite different from all of the past projects we have been doing, as most of the past projects only focus on one aspect and the sole aspect taught during that particular module (i.e. focus is only on the UI part for android development, AI models for AI project) but for this project as much as the emphasis is the database, it cannot be realised without a good UI design which requires all of the integration from user input back to database and it Is a lot more extensive in terms of scope and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I felt that the data population still takes disproportionately too much time as depending on the nature of the project, some tables can be self-generated based on relations if the project consists mostly of relational tables but if the project consists a lot of base tables and requires relationships to be built manually it is a lot of time spent.\n",
    "Overall, I felt that this project provided a very good starting point in creating websites and database systems with just a project idea in mind I am now able to think and plan out an entire system to fulfil the purpose. I think that this project has also allowed me to view from multiple perspectives, both as a user, designer of the interface and design of the database which helps me see how they connect and what would each stakeholder look out for. \n"
